# Tic_Tac_Toe-game-
first project in java advanced programming
In this game you can play alone with the computer
Or play with one of your friends as many times as you want
Unlike other games of this type that have 3 x 3 pages, in this game our desired page is 4 x 4 and randomly 3 houses are locked for players in each game.
In my opinion, the most challenging part of programming in this game
The part of determining the winners and losers was because the algorithm was long. (winOrlose)
